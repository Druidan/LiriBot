# liri-node-app
Unit 10 - This project will create a command-line version of siri that will use several different APIs to search for music, bands, and local shows.

##Goals & MVP:

##Node Dependancies and APIs:
* [Node Spotify API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) - This will be used when the actor uses LiriBot to search for music details.
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - This will be used to interface with the OMDB and Bands In Town APIs.
  * [OMDB - The Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) - Our users will be using our program to search details about movies, which will come from OMDB.
  * [BandsInTown API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api) - Similarly, when our users search for information about bands, the information will come from this API.
* [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) - We will be using Moment to format concert times.
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - We will be using dotenv to keep our keys secret, and keep them safe.

##Pseudo Code:
- [X] Create all of the files required in the instructions, including a gitignore, and push them to my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Druidan/liri-node-app) for the project.
- [ ] Dowload the dependancies and set up the require for each in liri.js.
